Liverpool Victoria,"Professional Services, Financial and Legal Services","LV= has over 5,700 employees 17 UK offices. The Ipswich office is a major claims handling centre for the firm's motor insurance business, dealing with customer and third party claims including vehicle accent repairs and write-offs, fire and theft, personal injury and property claims. It is the firm's centre of excellence for commercial motor insurance, including company car fleets, vans, trucks and private hire vehicles.
LV's presence in Ipswich began with its acquisition five years ago of the former Highway business, which at the time had around 90 people in the town. After a period of steady growth, the total has increased with a target of 450. Ipswich is now the second-largest claims centre within the group, the largest being in Bournemouth. 
Announcing the latest 120 person expansion in Ipswich, Peter Horton, the mutual firm's chief operating officer, said Ipswich was chosen from among a number of options as a location for expansion because of the quality of the existing team's performance. He was aware of Ipswich as a major centre for insurance and he praised the spirit and calibre of the team at the LV offices, and the high staff retention and low absenteeism figures being achieved",,Central,Crown House,Crown Street,Ipswich,IP1 3HS,1.1523889,52.0598494,08000 289 822,www.lv.com,,09:00 - 07:00,09:00 - 17:00,09:00 -17:00,09:00 - 17:00,09:00 -17:00,CLOSED,CLOSED,CLOSED,https://www.facebook.com/LV/,,https://twitter.com/lv?lang=en-gb,https://www.youtube.com/user/lv

The life was way too good to end too soon but money was running short. A plan was needed design some sweatshirts, sell 'em at night, ski during the day, stick around till Spring then head for the beach. Fat Face had been born.

We've grown a bit since then, we sell more than just a few sweatshirts these days and we've got a few more stores. But one thing will never change; we design kit for those who love to get out there, stuff that's built to withstand the demands of an active lifestyle. So, whether you're into extreme sports or just enjoy getting out amongst it our clothes are proudly designed by our team in England with a focus on modern styling and 'hero' pieces for your wardrobe. 

We care about the detail and we create clothes that are built to last, at prices you can trust. We wash them again and again, until they have that relaxed 'old favourite' feel, from new.

Urban Vintage,"Shopping, Clothing","

Urban Vintage opened February 2006 with a 1000 square foot store in the heart of Ipswich, it soon became a favourite destination for the fashion conscious individual. Since then the store has evolved quickly, bringing in a stream of new brands but also sticking with a few firm favourites. In December 2009 we moved to a new 1700 square foot site and only a year later extended to house a new premium section. In the last few years we have redesigned and refurbished the store to create an even more customer friendly environment.

In 2012 following being shortlisted finalists on three occasions we were winners of the UK's Best Young Fashion Store title at the prestigious Drapers Industry Awards. The store is judged from all aspects with a very high standard being required even for nomination. In 2012 and 13 we also finished 17th and 27th in the Drapers Inspiring Independents Awards, we believe this recognition is a result of our constant desire to evolve and provide the best possible service we can to our customers.

Our main aim at Urban Vintage has always been to provide an enjoyable shopping experience for our customers whether shopping online or in store, we pride ourselves on our customer service and the fact we offer honest reliable advice. We feel that this is reflected in our customer database, which is growing rapidly but also retains the customers that have been loyal to us since the day we opened.

We are official stockists of all brands featured on our site, shop with us with confidence.

The Ancient House,"Things to Do, History and Heritage","The Ancient House, also known as Sparrowe's House, is a Grade I listed building dating from the 15th century located in the Buttermarket area. In 1980 the building was acquired and restored by Ipswich Borough Council.
The earliest reference to a house on the site can be found in the 14th century, when it was owned by the knight, Sir Richard of Martlesham. In the 16th century the house was owned by a string of local merchants, including George Copping who acquired the property in 1567. It was Copping that commissioned the paneling of the ground floor room at the front of the house. He also built the 'long gallery'. The Sparrowe family became the owners of the house in 1603, and continued ownership for the next 300 years.
The decorative plasterwork (pargeting) and carving added in the 17th Century is one of the finest examples in the UK. The interior includes 16th Century wall paintings and further examples of carving and pargeting, and is also home to occasional art displays and exhibitions. The building features four panels representing the continents of Africa, Asia, Europe and America, (Australia hadn't, at the time, been discovered).
The house also has the Royal Arms of King Charles II on the side of the building which was added in around 1660.",#N/A,Central,St Stephen's Lane,,Ipswich,IP1 1BT,1.1552629,52.0565695,,,,CLOSED,CLOSED,00:00 -00:00,CLOSED,00:00 -00:00,CLOSED,CLOSED,CLOSED,,,,

The interior has many impressive and original features including the spy hole used to keep watch for attackers' or hostile officials and a richly carved and decorated high pulpit surrounded by box pews and a large three-sided gallery.

Ipswich Unitarian Meeting House retains its original aspect and character more or less intact. This adds to its rarity for few such Meeting Houses have survived, and fewer still without drastic alteration. The rarity is heightened still further by its timber-frame construction.

Five monasteries once stood in Ipswich and none of them survives today. Only the ruins of the Blackfriars Monastery give an idea of what these medieval monasteries looked like while the others have completely disappeared. 

In 1263, the Friary was founded and remained there for over 250 years. In the 16th Century, Henry VIII ordered to dissolve the monasteries and give their property to the state. After the closing in 1537, the monastery buildings were left standing - unlike their church of St. Peter and Paul whose ground was used to build a college. But in the 17th century they fell into disuse and some of them were quickly pulled down. After some decades, only the four arches of the Friary remained visible. It wasn't until the 1980s that the rest of the monastery was uncovered again and preserved.

The shelter was built in Ipswich during the first three months of the war, and was unusually robust compared to other public provisions.  This was partly due to the efforts of the controversial local MP, Richard Stokes, who campaigned for massive public air-raid shelters to be built under Alexandra Park.

After the war, the shelter was sealed up and largely forgotten.  It was re-discovered in 1989, when workmen excavating a small pond for the school found one of the original entrances.  To everyone's surprise the tunnels were in first class condition.

Members of IAA will be on hand at these and other major events during the year to answer questions or point visitors in the direction of the voluntary arts sector in the area.
IAA also maintain The Ipswich Charter Hangings, which celebrate the towns history and mark the granting of the Royal Charter in 1200AD. They are on display at St Peters Church and continue to attract many visitors.
IAA is also a campaigning organisation and, at a time when there are widespread cuts and challenges, it is raising questions about public resources including libraries, concert venues as well as the quality of arts provision in schools. Many of these topics form the basis for discussion at the  General Meetings held three times a year, in Ipswich, to which anyone is invited- whether or not they are involved with a local society.
The website is one of a number of ways in which IAA aims to keep in touch not only with it's members but also with the wider community. It provides an excellent way for societies to publicise their events as well as a diary of proposed events, which has long proved invaluable to those keen to avoid clashes with other events of the same kind or in the same locality.
In addition to helping to promote the work of IAA members, IAA publishes the IAA News & Events brochure, three times a year.

Harwich Haven is the best natural harbour on the east coast of England. The very first English settlers to colonise America left Ipswich aboard the 'Godspeed' and the 'Discovery' with Captain Bartholomew Gosnold in 1607, saying farewell to Suffolk from the river Orwell.

The AONB is 155 square miles of tranquil and unspoilt landscape, considered valuable of being conserved and enhanced for future generations. Within the southern part of the AONB the Shotley peninsula is important for it's wildlife and vistas, and is an area celebrated by artists, poets and writers.

The Stour and Orwell estuaries contain mudflats and saltmarsh which are a haven for wading birds. Every autumn 40,000 wildfowl and wading birds make an incredible journey to feed and roost here. Migrating birds, such as sandpiper and greenshank, are present in spring and autumn. Drainage dykes inland of the river walls provide a vital habitat for insects, including the Emperor Dragonfly, the largest in the UK.

Nancy Blackett,"Things to Do, Family Days Out, History and Heritage, Sport and Leisure","Nancy Blackett is a familiar sight, sailing on the River Orwell, the favourite yacht of author Arthur Ransome. 
'Swallows and Amazons' author Arthur Ransome bought her when he moved to this area in 1935. Nancy Blackett provided him with inspiration for one of his best books, We Didn't Mean to Go to Sea. It starts here on the Shotley Peninsula at Pin Mill , down the deep green lane that ended in the river itself&hellip; this happy place where almost everyone  wore sea-boots.  The four children, the 'Swallows', help to moor up a yacht, the Goblin, remarkably similar to the Nancy Blackett, and soon they are off sailing her down the river and mooring off Shotley Pier for the night.
Nancy Blackett was rediscovered, damaged and derelict, in Scarborough Harbour in the 1980s. She was brought back here, to Fox's marina, and carefully restored to the condition Ransome and the children in his book would have recognised.
Now she is owned by the Nancy Blackett Trust, which preserves and maintains her, and keeps her sailing for the benefit of all Ransome fans. Her sailing is undertaken with qualified volunteer skippers, with a mix of pre-planned programme and odd days, which members (anyone can become a member) can book for daysails or short trips. She is now berthed at Woolverstone Marina, Woolverstone, Ipswich.
You can also enjoy the Arthur Ransome Trail, with geocaches, which follows the Goblin's course alongside the Orwell from Pin Mill to Shotley Pier, and our exhibition of Arthur Ransome's 'Selina King ' photos at the Pin Mill Studio.",,,Woolverstone Marina,Woolverstone,Ipswich,IP9 1AS,1.193001,52.006984,01394 387907,https://nancyblackett.org/,info@nancyblackett.org,,,,,,,,,https://www.facebook.com/nancy.blackett1,,https://twitter.com/NancyBlackettUK,https://www.youtube.com/user/NancyBlackettTrust
